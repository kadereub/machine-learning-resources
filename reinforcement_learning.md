# Reinforcement Learning Resources
Contains some useful online deep reinforcement learning (RL) resources. 
These are just some of the resources that I came across while in search of a better understanding of the field.

## YouTube Video Resources

### Stanford Lecture Series

This is [from the CS234 course](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/index.html) (from Winter 2019). Presented by Professor Emma Brunskill.
It is a slightly more *updated* lecture series compared to the David Silver one.

### UCL Lecture Series

This is the RL course presented by Professor David Silver (of Deepmind). 
It was presented in 2015, so is a bit dated. However still a great resource, particularly for getting started.

## The Book of RL

This pretty much covers all the fundamentals needed to understand reinforcement learning. It is a good resource to use in conjunction with the above lectures.

* Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto: *Introduction to Reinforcement Learning* , 2015, [link](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf)

## Awesome Blogs/Online Docs

#### Lilian Weng's blog

This is a great blog by Lilian (a researcher @OpenAI) on primarly RL related topics.

* https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/
* Great post on [**Policy Gradient Algorithms**](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/04/08/policy-gradient-algorithms.html)

#### Andrej Kaparthy's blog

Wouldn't be deep learning without a link to Karpathy's posts. I think he has moved a lot of the more recent posts to Medium though.

* http://karpathy.github.io/
* https://medium.com/@karpathy
* Great post on [**Deep RL**](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/)
* Using `SuperDuper.fit` in [real life](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/)

#### Spinning Up

It is an entire site that makes it easier to learn about deep reinforcement learning (deep RL), by OpenAI. Really useful if you would like to learn all the basics, without having to read several text books.

* [Good explanation of the *RL Problem*](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html#the-rl-problem)

#### Jonathon Hui's Medium Deep RL Series

A nice comprehensive list of Deep RL resources and medium posts explaining various topics within RL. Really comprehensive and some good resources listed like the [UC Berkley bootcamp](https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp/lectures).

* https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/rl-deep-reinforcement-learning-series-833319a95530

### UC Berkeley Courses

* Introduction to AI, older lectures, [link](http://ai.berkeley.edu/lecture_videos.html).

* **Deep RL Course**, recently updated (2019), and has a nice resources page, [link](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/).

## Python Packages

* [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/), Used to setup your RL environment in which you will train the agent, by OpenAI.

* [Stable-Baselines](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/quickstart.html), a fork of baselines by OpenAI. Contains many *robust* implementations of RL Algorithms, and good documentation!
